Assuming
- demultiplexed fastq files (one sample per file) 

Note for fastq_suffix:
For file.fastq.gz the dot before "fastq.gz" is not included

# Notes for platform_unit_for_rg: 
# Platform_unit field in rg is not used for analysis in the pipeline. 
# It is set only for SAM compliance with Picard/GATK expectations.
# Option "from_illumina_fastq" instructs the script to unzip fastq1 file and 
# to read "instrument_run_flowcell_lane" data from the 1st line of the file.  
# This assumes that the fastq files were NOT merged from multiple lanes.  
# Also this assumes that fastq files are zipped and are compliant with illumina
# fastq headers as described below (link accessed 20Feb2017)
# https://help.basespace.illumina.com/articles/descriptive/fastq-files
# (this is likely to be true for any illumina fastq file)
# Use "project_library_lane" option if any of these assumptions are wrong. 


TODO for job description file: 
- Convert to JSON?
- Set efs mount points in all subnets (for allowing auto-allocation of ec2)
- Allow automatic allocation of ec2 instances to availability_zone
- see more comments in AWS settings section
